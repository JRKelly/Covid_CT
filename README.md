# Covid_CT
Scripts to analyze and visualize Connecticut's publically available Covid-19 data

*CT Schools Covid Cases to AGOL* -- retrieves per-school covid counts and town new case counts and updates fields in ArcGIS Online Feature Layers.

*CT Learning Models by District* -- shows "predominant" model per district (yellow = in person, green = hybrid, blue = remote, purple = no data or no predominant model).  Predominant model is the model employed by a plurality of grades within a district.
